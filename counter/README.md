Steps to setup the counter
--------------------------

* Box2D JavaScript port has been used to bring in the explosion effect. Box2D is a 2D rigid body simulation library for games. You can use it to make objects move in believable ways and make the game world more interactive. 

* Download all the necessary JavaScript files – base.js, box2d.js, io.js

* Change the variable “countdownTo” to the date you are counting down to.

* Include the JavaScript files in the HTML file and write script to initiate the counter.
